# Stream channels

Stream Channels are based on the room model. In a stream channel, users join a topic in order to send message to all users subscribed to that topic. Signaling enables each user to join up to one hundred channels at the same time. Each channel can have unlimited topics and up to 128 simultaneous users. Topics have a higher message transmission rate, greater message concurrency capability, and enable synchronous transmission of audio and video data. You use topics for Metaverse, AR/VR, interactive games, real-time collaboration, and parallel manipulation app.
