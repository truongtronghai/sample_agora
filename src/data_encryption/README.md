# Data encryption

Data encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel communicate with each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires data encryption, Signaling provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.
